# OrionQuest-MRTK

## Revisiting an Inspiring Demo

Leap Motion's Orion VR hand tracking demo was the first time I was able to use my hands in VR and I could tell this would be game-changing.
Once I got my Quest and hand tracking support was released, I knew I had to recreate that incredible demo.
This is a quick attempt to recreate some of the magic of that initial experience. Created using MRTK.

This is my version of the original Orion demo, with ability to change shapes and toggle gravity like in the original. Tested on Quest 1/2, working on Unity 2019.4+
